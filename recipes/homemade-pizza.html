            are someone who likes DIY projects and are looking for a change up in your pizza routine, <strong>this one is for you!</strong>

        <h4 class="h4headers pizza">Follow these steps to put it all together!</h4>

        <ol type="I">
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. 
                Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
                Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. 
                (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. 
                For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
